# async-local-storage

AsyncLocalStorage is an unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app in web browser. It should be used instead of LocalStorage.

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/async-local-storage.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@createnextapp/async-local-storage) ![npm bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/min/@createnextapp/async-local-storage)

## ‚ùì Why AsyncLocalStorage instead of LocalStorage?

**Cons of LocalStorage**

LocalStorage is synchronous, each local storage operation you run will be one-at-a-time. For complex applications this is a big no-no as it'll slow down your app's runtime.

**Pros of AsyncLocalStorage**

AsyncLocalStorage is asynchronous, each local async storage operation you run will be multi-at-a-time. It'll speed up your app's runtime.

The AsyncLocalStorage JavaScript code is a facade that provides [a clear JavaScript API](./API.md), real Error objects, and non-multi functions. Each method in the API returns a Promise object.
